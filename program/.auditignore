# Dependencies in Solana that are not directly used
RUSTSEC-2023-0042 # ouroboros - used by solana-runtime internally, not our contract

# Known compiler warnings that cannot be fixed (internal to Solana macros)
# These warnings come from the Solana entrypoint! macro's internal cfg attributes
# and are expected in the current Solana SDK version
SOLANA-CFG-WARNING-01 # unexpected `cfg` condition value: `custom-heap`
SOLANA-CFG-WARNING-02 # unexpected `cfg` condition value: `solana`
SOLANA-CFG-WARNING-03 # unexpected `cfg` condition value: `custom-panic`

# These should be resolved once Solana updates their dependencies in future SDK releases
