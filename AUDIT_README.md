# VCoin - Solidproof Audit Guide

## Project Overview

VCoin (VCN) is a Solana Token-2022 implementation with presale and vesting functionality. The project consists of a Rust smart contract and TypeScript client code.

## Key Components

### Smart Contract (Primary Audit Focus)

The Rust smart contract is located in the `/program` directory:

- `/program/src/processor.rs` - Main instruction handling
- `/program/src/state.rs` - Data structure definitions and state management
- `/program/src/vesting.rs` - Vesting implementation logic
- `/program/src/presale.rs` - Presale management logic
- `/program/src/entrypoint.rs` - Program entry point
- `/program/src/error.rs` - Error definitions
- `/program/src/instruction.rs` - Instruction definitions

### TypeScript Client Code

The TypeScript client code is in the `/src` directory:

- `/src/token2022-client.ts` - Client for interacting with SPL Token-2022
- `/src/presale.ts` - Presale client implementation
- `/src/vesting.ts` - Vesting client implementation
- `/src/utils.ts` - Utility functions and helpers

## Build Instructions

To build the Rust smart contract:

```bash
cd program
cargo build
```

To build the TypeScript client:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Authority Management**: The contract implements strict authority controls for mint, update, and fee operations.

2. **Input Validation**: All public functions validate inputs to prevent security issues.

3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling is implemented throughout the codebase.

4. **Overflow Protection**: The code includes checks to prevent arithmetic overflows.

5. **Reentrancy Protection**: The contract includes measures to prevent reentrancy attacks.

## Known Issues

1. The Rust code generates warnings related to Solana's internal macros but these do not affect functionality.

2. Some TypeScript tests may fail in the test environment but this doesn't affect the core smart contract functionality.

## Audit Focus Areas

We recommend focusing on:

1. Token allocation logic and security
2. Vesting implementation
3. Presale security and fund management
4. Authority control mechanisms
5. Validation of numeric operations

## Resolved Audit Findings

### Critical Issues

1. **Lack of Signature Verification for Configuration Files (RESOLVED)**
   
   **Description**: Configuration files, especially in `authority-controls.ts`, were not consistently verified for signature validity across all code paths.
   
   **Resolution**: Implemented a comprehensive solution that includes:
   - Mandatory signature verification for all configuration files
   - New `loadVerifiedConfig()` function that replaces direct usage of `loadAuthorityConfig()`
   - Configuration versioning system with version checks
   - Secure upgrade path for configuration files
   - Backup mechanism for configuration files
   - Production environment detection and enhanced security requirements
   
   **Implementation**:
   - Added `AUTHORITY_CONFIG_VERSION` for tracking configuration versions
   - Updated `AuthorityConfig` interface to include version field
   - Enhanced `loadAuthorityConfig()` to enforce signature verification
   - Created `loadVerifiedConfig()` as the primary way to load configurations
   - Added `upgradeAuthorityConfig()` function for safe version upgrades
   - Added `backupAuthorityConfig()` function for secure backups
   - Updated all functions to use `loadVerifiedConfig()` instead of direct loading

2. **Production-Specific Security Enhancements (IMPLEMENTED)**

   **Description**: The application needed additional security measures for production environments.
   
   **Implementation**:
   - Secure file operations with proper permissions (0o640 for files, 0o750 for directories)
   - Atomic file writes using temporary files and rename operations
   - Mandatory signature verification in production with no fallbacks
   - Automatic file permission correction with security warnings
   - All unsigned operations are rejected in production environments
   - Explicit NODE_ENV checks to prevent development behavior in production
   - Enhanced error logging for security-related issues
   - Permission verification on startup to detect potential tampering

### High Issues

(No high-severity issues reported)

### Medium Issues

1. **Inadequate Password Generation (RESOLVED)**

   **Description**: The `generateRandomPassword()` function used for keypair encryption was not secure enough for production use.

   **Resolution**: Implemented a comprehensive solution that includes:
   - Production environment detection
   - Mandatory secure passwords in production environments
   - Enhanced password generation for development
   - Clear documentation and .env examples

2. **Race Conditions in File Access (RESOLVED)**

   **Description**: Multiple processes could access the same files simultaneously, leading to potential data corruption.

   **Resolution**: Implemented proper file locking using the `proper-lockfile` library to prevent race conditions.

3. **Inconsistent Error Handling (RESOLVED)**

   **Description**: The codebase had inconsistent error handling practices across different modules, leading to unpredictable behavior and making debugging difficult, especially in production environments.

   **Resolution**: Implemented a standardized error handling approach throughout the codebase:
   - Created a hierarchy of custom error classes extending a base `VCoinError` class
   - Defined specialized error classes for different error types (ValidationError, SecurityError, etc.)
   - Added error codes to all custom errors for easier programmatic handling
   - Implemented a standardized `handleError()` function that handles errors differently based on environment
   - Updated all modules to use custom error classes and the standardized error handling approach
   - Added context information to error handling for better tracking and debugging
   - Created comprehensive documentation in ERROR_HANDLING.md

   **Implementation**:
   - Updated `update-metadata.ts`, `presale.ts`, `upgrade-governance.ts`, and other key files
   - Enhanced error propagation through the call stack for better error tracing
   - Added production-specific error handling behaviors with minimal information disclosure
   - Improved logging of security-critical errors
